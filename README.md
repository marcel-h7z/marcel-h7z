## 🚀 **About Me**  
I'm a **Senior Software Engineer** with over **15 years** of hands-on experience crafting scalable, high-impact systems that power billions of users daily. Currently at **Meta Platforms** (formerly Facebook), I lead cross-functional teams in AI, blockchain, metaverse, and frontend development, focusing on performance, security, and innovation.  

From my early days at **Microsoft** optimizing cloud services with .NET and Azure, to architecting AI pipelines with **PyTorch** and **Llama** at Meta, I've thrived in fast-paced environments solving complex problems. My journey started with a **Bachelor's in Computer Science** from **Tecnológico de Monterrey** (Class of 2010, with honors), where I honed my skills in algorithms and data structures.  

Passionate about **emerging tech**, I explore **generative AI**, **Web3 decentralization**, and **immersive VR/AR** for real-world applications like healthcare and finance. Outside code, I mentor aspiring devs, contribute to open-source, and stay sharp with certifications in **Deep Learning** and **MLOps**. Let's connect if you're into AI ethics, blockchain scalability, or building the future of the metaverse!
